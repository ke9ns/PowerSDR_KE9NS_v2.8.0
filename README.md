# PowerSDR_KE9NS_v2.8.0

Based on the last version of FlexRadio PowerSDR v2.7.2
This is a highly modified version of that PowerSDR software
see ke9ns.com\flexpage.html#GPLREV for revision history since 2.7.2
Written in C# (PowerSDR), C (DttSP), C++(PowerMate)

Currently compiled under VS2022 (including C and C++ and C# modules) and .NET 4.5.2
(Newer .NET will comiple but will not operate correcty on computers using a comma dilimiter)
VS2022 does not preinstall .NET 4.5.2 so you will need to go and download and install.

Make sure the "Set startup project" is "PowerSDR" otherwise the project will not compile
