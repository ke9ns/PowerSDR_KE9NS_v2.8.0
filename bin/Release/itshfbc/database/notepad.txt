notepad.exe

Put on the first line the path to the program you want to use
to view the output from Run/Circuit results.
This affects ICEPAC, VOACAP, REC533, HFANT, S_I ICEPAC, and S_I VOACAP.
So, if you wish, you can change the program to use wordpad.exe.
You may need to put in the full pathname.
On my computer, it is:
C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\wordpad.exe
Your system may have a different path.
