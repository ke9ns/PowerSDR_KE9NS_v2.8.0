Where:
      xxxxx      = Noise Type (1=Man-Made noise,  2=Total noise)
      yyyyy      = Band Width in KHz (default=1KHz)
      aaaaaaaaaa = measured Noise @  2.5 MHz
      bbbbbbbbbb = measured Noise @  5.0 MHz
      cccccccccc = measured Noise @  7.5 MHz
      dddddddddd = measured Noise @ 10.0 MHz
      eeeeeeeeee = measured Noise @ 20.0 MHz
      ffffffffff = measured Noise @ 30.0 MHz
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Measured noise is from the paper:
Measurement of HF Monopole Antenna Array Ground Wave Gain, Antenna Factor,
and Antenna Noise Factor by Virgilio P. Arafiles.
The measured noise values are from equation 8 and are really En+Gr.
The value of the measurement bandwidth (b) is the input value yyyyy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not for use in this GUI interface.
Should only be used by the sponsor who requested the change as they are
aware of the limitations.

New input card (for ICEAREA only) to define measured noise
Place this card at the END of the xxxxx.ICE data file.
This will be AFTER the "Tx Ants" card.
No ":" is needed in column 10, but it can be there to be consistent with the others.
Realize that this will cause the same same noise values at each grid point.
This will be true if "Noise Type=2=Total noise".
If "Noise Type=1=Man-Made noise" is selected, only man-made noise will be
the same at each grid point. Since the noise at each grid point is a combination
of Atmospheric+ManMade+Galactic, the total noise will be different.
But the important thing to know is IT IS NOT CORRECT!
But the sponsor knows this.
