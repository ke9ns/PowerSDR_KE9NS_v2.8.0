Look for HFWIN32 and Versions and you will see files such as:
     itshfbc_051218.exe
That identifies the year, month, day created.

Place this file in a temporary directory and install it by
executing it.

Installation from 1.4 MByte diskettes is no longer supported.

Suggested system configuration:
    The software was developed on:
         Pentium 4 - 2.80 GHz
         MS-Windows-2000 - Service Pack 4
         1 GBytes ram
         20 inch display using 1280x1024 raster points/256 colors.

Minimum system requirements (for 32-bit version):
   
    System running Windows-95/98/NT/2000/XP
    4 MBytes ram - 16 MBytes recommended
        depending on how many applications you have open, you may
        obtain the message "Insufficient Memory for Application".
        Closing unnecessary applications or increasing the virtual
        memory under Control Panel - 386 Enhanced can remove this
        problem.
    Hard Disk - 20 Mbytes + lots of extra depending on use
    VGA graphics card
        The software will work on a 640x480 display, but if
        possible, configure your display to use more.
        A 14 inch display works well with 800x600. If your display
        uses only 16 colors, the graphics plots will suffer.
    At least a 486x33MHz processor with math co-processor
        (a 386 will work but is too slow for any substantial work)
    Black & White graphic output can be made to any Windows printer.
        A laser printer with minimum memory (512k bytes) will work
        but you may need to remove the border from the plot.
    Color graphic hard copies - works to some devices, but some drivers
        do not seem to work well.  HP PaintJet has problems, but it
        appears to be the driver fault.  Other color printers do work.
