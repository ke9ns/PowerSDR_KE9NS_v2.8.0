22 Jul  2012   1. A error in the VOACAP smoothing (Method=30) algorithm
                  was fixed. It has been there a long time and I do not
                  know why it just surfaced.  There was an undefined
                  variable and it surfaced as a floating point stack fault.
                  Initially this fixed caused another problem that I fixed
                  the next day. Sorry.
