08 Dec  2009    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

08 Dec  2009   1. A change was made in the installation to allow HAMCAP
                  installations to know where the software was installed.
                  The uninstall information can be found in the registry under:
                  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
                  uninstall\{1B328085-F1A5-4AB8-8986-0103C5800216}
                  The strange string:
                     {1B328085-F1A5-4AB8-8986-0103C5800216}
                  is called the GUID (Globally Unique IDentifier).
                  It is generated by the Tarma installer and it has been
                  set so it will never change.
