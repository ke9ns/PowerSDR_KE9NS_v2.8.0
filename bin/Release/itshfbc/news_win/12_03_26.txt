26 Mar  2012    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

26 Mar  2012   1. ICEPAC had an undefined variable that could cause the
                  program to think it was in Area Coverage mode when it
                  was supposed to run in Point-to-Point mode. This appeared
                  to be a rare occurance and may be computer/operating system
                  dependent. This has been fixed. 
                  VOACAP & REC533 were not affected.
