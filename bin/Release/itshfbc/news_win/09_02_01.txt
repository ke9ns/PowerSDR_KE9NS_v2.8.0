01 Feb  2009   1. A problem was found in REC533.
                  If the receive location is in the western hemisphere, such as 90W,
                  the output file would show a value like 270W.
                  The calculations were all correct, just the display of the
                  receive location was wrong. This has been fixed.
                  A lot of strange things contributed to this.
                  1. For some unknown reason in REC533, east longitude is NEGATIVE.
                  2. For noise calculations, a longitude between 0-360 was needed.
                  I think these conflicting problems arose because REC533 was
                  created by cannibalizing software from different developers.
