14 Feb  2009    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

14 Feb  2009   1. This version should only affect REC533.
                  Chris Behm of NTIA/ITS (behm@its.bldrdoc.gov) has been
                  modifying REC533 to add digital modulation calculations.
                  This is in conjuction with the ITU in Geneva.
                  This required some changes in the input GUI, as you will
                  notice an extra input line for Modulation.
                  VOACAP & ICEPAC are not affected.
                  Currently, this only works for the REC533 Point-to-Point model.
                  It is being tested, and eventually, will be added to
                  RECAREA (the area coverage model).
                  Eventually, I will have Chris write some information about it.
