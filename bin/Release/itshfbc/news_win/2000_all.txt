All     2000    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

02 May  2000   1. A "to Clipboard" button was added to Method 11 & 28 
                  circuit plots for ICEPAC & VOACAP.

23 May  2000   1. Some minor problems have been solved for Point-to-Point VOACAP
                  when calculating multiple groups.  It may have been unable to
                  find the proper set of data to plot.  That should work now.

               2. Also, the previous version (00.0502) probably had fixed
                  contours set for VOACAP DBU plots.  That should be back to
                  its original scaling using the maximum value.

05 June 2000   1. A problem was corrected in ICEPAC & VOACAP Point-to-Point
                  when plotting parameters using the Run/Time option.

05 July 2000   1. VOACAP Point-to-Point did not function correctly when you
                  specified a day-of-the-month when the RUN/GRAPH was selected.
                  The results calculated would have been for URSI coefficients
                  without the daily coefficients used.  That has been corrected.

24 July 2000   1. I have increased the allowable SSN to be in the range 0-250.
                  The previous limit of 200 was recently exceeded.

               2. The zip code for our address has changed.
                  Thus, all the ABOUT windows have been changed to reflect
                  the new zip code of 80305.

26 July 2000   1. There were problems running VOACAP from the command line if
                  you wanted to use the SILENT option so nothing is shown on
                  the screen.  That has now been fixed.  It should function
                  the same as ICEPAC as described in the 98_all.txt news file.

14 Aug  2000   1. These current modification to the HF propagation software
                  should only be of use to VOA for their Planning software.
                  Other broadcast administrations may be interested in these
                  modifications when the software has been completed.
                  It is currently in the development stage.

01 Sep  2000   1. These current modification to the HF propagation software
                  should only be of use to VOA for their Planning software.
                  Other broadcast administrations may be interested in these
                  modifications when the software has been completed.
                  It is currently in the development stage.

                  Minor changes have been made to the general HF programs,
                  but they should not be noticed by the normal user.

08 Sep  2000   1. The HELP files for IBB_PLAN have been completed.
                  This should only affect users of IBB_PLAN which are the VOA
                  and perhaps members of the HFCC.

04 Oct  2000   1. Saving a data file in ICEPAC that used METHOD 23 could not
                  be OPENed and read.  That has been fixed.

11 Nov  2000   1. Some Help files were left off previous installations.
                  They have been added.

04 Dec  2000   1. A new SALFLIBC.DLL has been obtained from Salford.
                  That is a file that gets put into your C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM
                  directory.  Hopefully it causes no one problems.

               2. You can now specify up to 16 character file names in the
                  Area Coverage versions of the software.  This will NOT work
                  if you want to use the names in the COMBINE option, however.
                  Someday that may be fixed.

               3. Thanks to Brenton Vogelsang of Australia, the ICEPAC
                  Technical Manual and old User's Manual have been converted
                  to Word 7.0 format.  That allowed us to also provide them
                  in PDF format.  These are available from the web site where
                  you download the software.

               4. At the request of our lawayers, a DISCLAIMER has been added
                  to all the Help/About windows and in the README.TXT file.
                  It is:
