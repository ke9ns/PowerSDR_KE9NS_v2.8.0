Suggested system configuration:
    The software was developed on:
         Pentium-266 with Windows-95.
         32 MBytes ram
         17 inch display using 1280x1024 raster points/256 colors.

Minimum system requirements:
   
    System running Windows 3.1
    4 MBytes ram - 16 MBytes recommended
        depending on how many applications you have open, you may
        obtain the message "Insufficient Memory for Application".
        Closing unnecessary applications or increasing the virtual
        memory under Control Panel - 386 Enhanced can remove this
        problem.
    Hard Disk - 20 Mbytes + lots of extra depending on use
    VGA graphics card
        The software will work on a 640x480 display, but if
        possible, configure your display to use more.
        A 14 inch display works well with 800x600. If your display
        uses only 16 colors, the graphics plots will suffer.
    At least a 486x33MHz processor with math co-processor
        (a 386 will work but is too slow for any substantial work)
    Black & White graphic output can me made to any Windows printer.
        A laser printer with minimum memory (512k bytes) will work
        but you may need to remove the border from the plot.
    Color graphic hard copies (does not yet work)

I currently no longer have the ability to re-compile the 16-bit version
that works under Windows 3.x.  Hopefully, everyone will be soon moving
to Window-95 or Windows-NT.

You comments are welcomed.
