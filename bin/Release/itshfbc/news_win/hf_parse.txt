| The propagation modules VOACAPW.EXE or ICEPACW.EXE cannot be executed        |
| individually unless you have created the proper formated data input file.    |
| If you change the ANTENNA card after an EXECUTE card, you MUST use HF_PARSE  |
| to do the calculations. This is because of how the antenna calculations are  |
| performed. This problem was discovered in Dec 2008 by Jari Perkiomaki of     |
| Finland while doing some special analysis.                                   |
| If you do not have extra ANTENNA cards, this is not a problem.               |

| Execute with:                                                                |
|   hf_parse.exe [S] directory model inputfile outputfile                      |
| where:                                                                       |
|   [S]       = SILENT, no messages are written to screen                      |
|             = QUIET, only 1 message written for each EXECUTE card            |
|   directory = full pathname to the install directory (e.g. c:\ITSHFBC)       |
|   model     = VOACAP or ICEPAC                                               |
|                                                                              |
| The input and output files will be in the ..\RUN directory.                  |
|                                                                              |
| You will probably need to also include the full pathname to the EXE file.    |
| Thus, using the default installation directory:                              |
|                                                                              |
|   c:\itshfbc\bin_win\hf_parse.exe c:\itshfbc voacap filein fileout           |
|                                                                              |
