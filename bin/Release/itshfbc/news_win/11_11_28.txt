28 Nov  2011    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

28 Nov  2011   1. REC533 Point-to-Point did not work in the Batch mode.
                  That has been fixed.

               2. REC533 also had a problem if you selected a Noise level [1-6]
                  on the System card. There was a variable spelled wrong in the
                  source code (MA instead of MAN). I think this had been there
                  for many years. How it ever worked is beyond me.

               3. HFANT had a problem for Type 11 (gain table vs elevation angle) antennas.
                  If you plotted the pattern, it would identify the Elevation
                  angle at Gmax (maximum gain) wrong. It was off by 1 degree.

               4. HFANT also had a problm with Type 14 (Point-to-point gain table
                  vs elev/freq) antennas. It would produce the elevation angle
                  at maximum gain for the whole set of frequencies. It should be
                  producing the elevation angle at maximum gain for the specified
                  frequency in the plot.
