05 Sep  2014    News for NTIA/ITS HF Propagation Models (WINDOWS version)

05 Sep  2014   1. There was an error in the area coverage calculation for the Type 48
                  antenna (NOSC Inverted Cone). This only affects this antenna.
                  But the error was in all 3 propagation models (VOACAP, ICEPAC, REC533).
                  It was caused by a misspelled variable name.

               2. It has been so long since I put out a new version, I hope other problems
                  do not occur. :)

                  This version had some problems and was removed from the download.
